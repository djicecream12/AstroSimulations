# 🌌 Solar System Simulation

This simulation models all eight planets orbiting the Sun in a scaled-down 3D solar system. It uses circular orbits and different angular speeds to match the orbits of each planet in real-time. Using arrow keys on the keyboard, you can increase or decrease the time (which adjusts the speeds of the planets).
