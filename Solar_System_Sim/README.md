# 🌌 Solar System Simulation

This simulation models all major planets orbiting a central star in a scaled-down 2D solar system. It uses circular orbits and different angular speeds for each planet.

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- Orbital speed vs distance
- Scale modeling of the solar system
- Visualization of multiple-body motion

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
python main.py
```
