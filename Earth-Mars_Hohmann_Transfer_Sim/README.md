# 🌍 Earth-Mars Hohmann Transfer Visualizer

This project simulates the interplanetary transfer from Earth to Mars using a Hohmann transfer orbit. It uses Python and matplotlib to animate the orbits of Earth, Mars, and a spacecraft in a 3D space, giving an intuitive view of orbital dynamics and launch windows.
