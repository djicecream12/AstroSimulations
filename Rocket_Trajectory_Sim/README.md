# 🚀 Rocket Trajectory Simulator

This project simulates a vertically launched rocket's motion considering gravitational force, air drag, and thrust. The program calculates and plots real-time altitude, velocity, and time until the rocket returns to the ground. It displays key performance stats like maximum altitude and total flight duration.
