# 🛰️ Space Debris Cleanup Simulation

This project simulates three autonomous satellites for each orbit (LEO, MEO, GEO) that tracks and removes space debris. The satellite will trail the debris and clear it, modelling detection range, classification, and pursuit behavior.

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- Orbital debris mitigation
- Autonomous navigation logic
- Sensor range and AI targeting behavior

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- Possibly `random` or `pygame` (update if used)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
python main.py
```
